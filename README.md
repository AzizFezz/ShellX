# ShellX

This shell programmed in C is a command-line interface program that provides various built-in commands and advanced features for command execution.
Built-in Commands:
  
  history: This command allows users to view the command history, showing previously executed commands.
  
  cd: It enables users to change the current working directory.
  
  quit: This command terminates the shell and exits the program.
  
  help: It provides assistance and displays information about the available commands or how to use the shell.
  
  Multiple Pipes: ShellX supports executing commands with multiple pipes. Pipes are used to connect the output of one command to the input of another, enabling data flow between them.
                  With this feature, users can chain multiple commands together, where the output of one command serves as the input for the next.
  
  Input and Output Redirection: ShellX allows input and output redirection for commands. Input redirection enables users to take input from a file rather than the standard input stream,
                                while output redirection allows users to redirect the output of a command to a file instead of displaying it on the standard output.
                                This feature provides flexibility in managing input and output for command execution.
